Auto crafters are an automated way to get your crafting needs met (duh). There are 3 different tiers from 1-3, each tier they craft much faster but also use more energy. Tier 1 costs 5k, Tier 2 10k, and Tier 3 20k. /advance them all to auto craft what ever you want!
To build the auto crafter you will need 8 Tier blocks, (Iron, Gold, or Diamond) 8 Glass Panes, 3 Glass blocks, 2 Titanium blocks, 3 droppers, 1 noteblock, 1 furnace (with 1 focusing lens in each slot), and 2 wire/end rods
