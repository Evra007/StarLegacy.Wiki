# Auto Crafters
Auto crafters are an automated way to get your crafting needs met (duh). 
Auto Crafters come in 3 tiers. Higher tiers craft items faster (thus using more power).
- **Tier 1** (Iron) (2 crafts/second) (200,000 power capacity)
- Tier 2 10k,
- **Tier 3** (Diamond) (6 crafts/second) (600,000 power capacity)

/advance them all to auto craft what ever you want!

- The Input is the dropper on top of the glass, left of the sign.
